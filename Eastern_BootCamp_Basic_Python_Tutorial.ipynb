If we pass only one variable into the function then that variable is used for the stop value and 0 is used as default value for start. This range(8) produces the following iterable 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 once again 8 is excluded as it is the stop value. The final argument is step which determines the gap between each subsequent value. The default value is set to 1 and hence we do not need to enter any value for step.\n",

        "\n",
        "A module is a file containing Python code, which can include variables, functions, and classes. Modules are used to organize and encapsulate related code, making it easier to manage and reuse code across multiple programs. Modules help keep your codebase organized and maintainable by providing a way to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a explanation of modules in Python, along with examples of how to create and use them in your code:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Creating a Module:**\n",
        "A module is typically implemented as a `.py` file. To create a module, you can create a new Python file and write your code in it. For example, let's create a module named `my_module.py`:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# my_module.py\n",
        "\n",
        "def greet(name):\n",
        "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "def square(x):\n",
        "    return x ** 2\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, `my_module.py` contains two functions: `greet` and `square`. These functions can be accessed and used in other Python programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Using a Module:**\n",
        "To use the functions and variables defined in a module, you need to import the module into your Python script. You can import a module using the `import` keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# main.py\n",
        "import my_module\n",
        "\n",
        "# Using functions from my_module\n",
        "result = my_module.greet(\"Alice\")\n",
        "print(result)  # Output: \"Hello, Alice!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "num = 5\n",
        "square_result = my_module.square(num)\n",
        "print(square_result)  # Output: 25\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, we import the `my_module` module and then use its `greet` and `square` functions in the `main.py` script.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Accessing Module Items Directly:**\n",
        "Alternatively, you can import specific items (functions, variables, or classes) from a module and use them directly without specifying the module name.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# main.py\n",
        "from my_module import greet\n",
        "\n",
        "result = greet(\"Bob\")\n",
        "print(result)  # Output: \"Hello, Bob!\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, we only import the `greet` function from `my_module` and use it directly in the `main.py` script.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Using Aliases:**\n",
        "You can also use aliases when importing modules or items to avoid naming conflicts. You will see this a lot when going throught various python documentations and projects!\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "print(result)  # Output: \"Hello, Charlie!\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, we import `my_module` with the alias `mm`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Standard Library Modules:**\n",
        "Python comes with a rich standard library that includes many modules for common tasks. You can import and use these modules without needing to install anything separately. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import math\n",
        "\n",
        "result = math.sqrt(16)\n",
        "print(result)  # Output: 4.0\n",

        "\n",
        "Here, we import the `math` module to access the `sqrt` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Creating Your Own Packages:**\n",
        "When your Python project becomes more extensive, you can organize related modules into packages. Packages are directories containing multiple modules and an `__init__.py` file. This allows you to create a hierarchical structure for your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "```plaintext\n",
        "my_package/\n",
        "    __init__.py\n",
        "    module1.py\n",
        "    module2.py\n",
        "```\n",

        "# Importing modules from a package\n",
        "from my_package import module1, module2\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        " You can create your own modules to encapsulate functions and variables, and you can also use modules from the Python standard library or third-party libraries to extend the functionality of your programs. Importing modules allows you to access the code within them, making it easier to build complex and modular applications."
